Write a Python program that plays this game. It can ask for two inputs, one from each of two players or it can play one player against the computer.

To have the computer play against you, you can use the random number generator.

This is a good application for a green and red LED to indicate a win or loss, so 1 bonus point if you include (commented) the correct code to do that. You also have an ultrasonic sensor - rather than have the user enter their choice, maybe they put their hand near the sensor at one of 5 levels? Something else wild and crazy? Bonus points might be available...
